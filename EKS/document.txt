  here we can see  the status of the pod
  


we are commenting above in the main.tf because pod are getting failed or in pending state becaiuse above line 

The taint block in your EKS node group acts like a "Do Not Enter" sign that blocks all pods from scheduling on those nodes unless they have a special permission (toleration). 
  Your code taint { key = "dedicated", value = "gpuGroup", effect = "NO_SCHEDULE" } tells Kubernetes "these are GPU-only nodes—no web apps allowed," causing your deployment pods to fail with "FailedScheduling.
  " For learning, simply delete the entire taint block from the Terraform code and run terraform apply.
  This removes the restriction, making your t3.large nodes accept all pods immediately, fixing the issue without complex tolerations.
